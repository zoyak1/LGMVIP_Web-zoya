## About

We all write out to-dos some where and then just forget them. At the end, nothing is done. But you can use this **online** to-do list app to store all your to-dos.
Now if you just **re-open the site** you will have all your to-dos saved there waiting for you to check them.

TODO-app has **2 branches**. First is the main branch, this branch is for **developing**. The second is the website branch, this branch is used to deploy <a href="https://anargya-anubhawa.github.io/todo-app/">**Github Pages**</a> and <a href="https://great-todo.netlify.app/">**Netlify**</a>.

## Caution

If you format your disc or you clear the browser data your to-dos will be gone as **localStorage** is used here to save the data.
